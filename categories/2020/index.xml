      <description>This article tries to write down some notes while trying to solve problem 1552.
I think this problem can be restated as follows: given some positive integers with total size n, pick m numbers such that minimum distance among each selected is maximum.
When first see this problem, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a knapsack problem: every number will be selected or not, find those possible combinations (pick m from n), calculate minimum distance, choose maximum from them.</description>

      <description>Thinking After brute force to find a solution and think about this proble, I have some other observations.
Initially I have the idea to choosing closest middle cut in range, and it fails to guarantee always global optimal result.
More specifically, the heuristic fails at this test case: n = 30, cuts = [5, 7, 13, 15, 18, 25, 26, 29]
According to find closest middle cut, it will choose 15 as first cut since it&amp;rsquo;s the the half of 30, and best min cuts under 15 is 94, one of the possible outcome is [15, 7, 5, 13, 25, 26, 29, 18]</description>

      <description>This article is to write down some notes while solving this problem.
Greedy I started with this example:
 n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
   initial status:
 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 0 7    first cut at 3:
 _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _ 0 3 3 7  cost: 7 (because total length before cut is 7)</description>

      <title>Raise Coverate Rate to 80</title>

      <description>Recently I have done raising unit tests coverage rate of 2 packages to at least 80%. Of course, high coverage rate isn&amp;rsquo;t always a gold standard to achieve, and some corner conditions are not necessray to test, so 80% seems a number that tries to demonstrate most code paths are testable.
These 2 packges with 0% and 20% unit test coverate rate at the time I started to modify. After some refactoring, both packages&amp;rsquo; coverage rate reaches 80%.</description>
